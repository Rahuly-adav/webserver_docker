# webserver_docker
here we are creating a web server using docker image which I have pushed to docker public repository.
This image is pre installed with all the software which we are trying to install using Dockerfile. By running container through this image we have running webserver on apache2/httpd.
to run the container using this image run following command or just run container.sh file.
        
        bash container.sh
 
or we can directly run 

        docker run -it --name webserver rahulyadav2183/webserver
